# VPINN: Variational Physics-Informed Neural Nets 
### Daniel Boutros, Thomas Gaskin, Oscar de Wit

A machine learning tool for solving weak non-linear PDEs, developed for the CMI
core course project at the University of Cambridge. It is based on [work](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2020.113547)
by Ehsan Kharazmi et al. Our code covers one- and two-dimensional domains,
and includes several additional differential equations that can be solved. The model can be controlled from a config file.
The code is implemented using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/) and is unit-tested.


### Required packages

The following packages are required to run the code. We recommend installing these
into a virtal environment to avoid interfering with system-wide package installations.

| Package    | Version  | Comments                         |
|------------|----------|----------------------------------|
| Python     | \>= 3.9  |                                  |
| Pytorch    | \>= 1.10 | Machine learning package.        |
| PyYAML     | \>= 6.0  | Handles configuration            |
| matplotlib |          | Handles plotting                 |
| latex      |          | Recommended for plotting         |
| pytest     |          | Optional; used for running tests |

> **_Note:_**  On Apple Silicon, using the GPU to train is currently [WIP](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/47702).

### Running the model
To execute, run the `main.py` file. Results are stored in the `Results` folder â€” make sure not to delete it.
#### Modifying model parameters
All settings should be modified from the `config.yml` file. The following is a list of the relevant parameters:

#### Modifying the external forcing
To modify the external forcing, go to the `function_definitions.py` file and modify the function called `f`. Test functions can
be modified in `Utils/test_functions`. One-dimensional test functions must take two inputs: an x-value, and an `int n` which serves as
a label for the test function.

#### Adding new equation types
To let the model solve new equation types, add a new file to the `Utils/Variational_forms.py` folder, and include it in the
module by adding it to `Variational_forms/__init__.py`. Return your new
variational loss in the `variational_loss` function in the `VPINN` class (`VPINN.py`).

> **_Note:_** It is essential that all your datatypes have the same _dimensions_ when calculating
> the losses. If your loss functions stay constant even for a high number of iterations,
> this may be indicative of incompatible data dimensions, e.g. between training data and model
> predictions. pytorch will not throw an error, but will simply not be able to correctly perform
> the backwards pass through the loss calculation.

> **_Hint:_** We recommend making use of the _testing_ capabilities when implementing new
> features (see below). Use the testing tools provided to first write comprehensive tests for whatever it is you wish to implement,
> thereby making sure your feature behaves as expected. This will significantly reduce the time you
> spend debugging the code.

### Custom data types

We have implemented several custom data types to facilitate handling
multidimensional data, as well as data on grids. These types are implemented in the `Utils/Datatypes`
folder. They are all subscriptable and iterable.

#### The `Grid` class:
```python
class Grid(*, x: Sequence = None, y: Sequence = None)
```
This implements a grid from a list of coordinates. A grid can be either one- or two-dimensional,
depending on how many arguments are passed. Grid attributes can be easily accessed via several useful
member functions: ```grid.x``` and ```grid.y``` return the coordinate axes, while ```grid.data```
returns the grid as an array of points. ```grid.boundary``` returns the grid boundary. ```grid.dim``` returns the
dimension of the grid, and ```grid.size``` returns the number of points it contains. ``grid.volume`` returns the
grid volume.

#### The `DataSet` class:
```python
class DataSet(*, x: Sequence, f: Sequence,
              as_tensor: bool = False, data_type: tf.DType = tf.dtypes.float64)
```
The `DataSet` class is similar in syntax to `pandas.DataFrame`, but allowing for compatibility with
tensorflow types. A `DataSet` contains points and data values --- the former can be accessed via
`DataSet.coords`, the latter via `DataSet.data`. If `as_tensor` is set to `True`, the elements will be
`tf.Tensors`, allowing for them to be passed to a neural net. The `DataSet` can return only the coordinates of
a particular axis via `DataSet.axis()`, as well as the shorthands `DataSet.x` and `DataSet.y` for convenience.
`DataSet.dim` and `DataSet.size` returns the dimensions of the coordinates and the size of the data set respectively.

### Running tests

The code is unit-tested to ensure correct functionality. It is recommended that you test
any changes or additions you make to the package. To run tests, navigate to the folder containing the `main.py` file, enter your
virtual environment, and execute `python -m pytest -v Tests/`. This will run *all* tests in the `Tests` folder.
To run individual tests, simply specify the file you wish to run.
